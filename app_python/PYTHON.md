# Python Web Application with Flask

This document outlines the best practices applied in developing a web application using Python with the Flask framework. It covers adherence to coding standards, implementation of testing, and ensuring code quality.

## Why Flask?
Flask is chosen for several reasons when developing web applications in Python:

- **Simplicity and Minimalism**: Flask is lightweight and designed to be simple and easy to use. It doesn't come with built-in features that you may not need, allowing developers to choose and integrate only the components necessary for their specific project.

- **Flexibility**: Flask provides a flexible framework that allows developers to structure their applications according to their preferences. It doesn't enforce any specific patterns or restrictions, giving developers the freedom to implement their logic and architecture.

- **Extensibility**: Flask supports a wide range of extensions that can easily be integrated into applications to add additional functionality. These extensions cover various aspects such as authentication, database integration, RESTful APIs, and more, allowing developers to enhance their applications without reinventing the wheel.

## Best Practices Applied:
1. **Project Structure**:
-- Organize the project structure logically, separating concerns such as application logic, templates, and static files.
-- Use a modular approach for routing and application logic to keep code organized and maintainable.
2. **Code Readability and Standards**:
-- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for code formatting to ensure consistency and readability.
-- Use meaningful variable and function names to enhance code understanding.
3. **Template Usage**:
-- Utilize Flask's built-in template engine for generating HTML pages.
-- Keep HTML templates clean and organized, separating layout and content where possible.
4. **Data Handling**:
-- Employ appropriate libraries for handling date and time operations (datetime and pytz in this case).
-- Ensure proper handling of timezone conversions and localization to provide accurate information to users.

## Implementation Details:
- **Coding Standards**: Adhered to PEP 8 guidelines for code formatting and style.
- **Testing**: Unit tests could be implemented using frameworks like pytest to verify the functionality of the get_moscow_time function and ensure it returns the expected output for different scenarios.
